// In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator (=).

myVariable = 7;

// This assigns the Number value 7 to myVariable.

// If there are any calculations to the right of the = operator, those are performed before the value is assigned to the variable on the left of the operator.

var myVar;

myVar = 5;

// First, this code creates a variable named myVar. Then, the code assigns 5 to myVar. Now, if myVar appears again in the code, the program will treat it as if it is 5.

// TASK

// Assign the value 7 to variable a.

var a;

a = 7;

console.log(a);

// Console should log the number: "7".
