// Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

var myVar;

// But you can also declare a string variable like this:

var myName = "your name";

// "your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

// TASK

// Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

var myFirstName = "Nedo";

var myLastName = "Ratic";

console.log(myFirstName);

console.log(myLastName);

// Console should output two strings: "Nedo" and "Ratic".
