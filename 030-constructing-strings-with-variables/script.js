// Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

// Example:

const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";

const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

console.log(ourStr);

// ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.

// TASK

// Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings My name is  and  and I am well!

// Only change code below this line

const myName = "Nedo Ratic";

const myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";

console.log(myStr);
