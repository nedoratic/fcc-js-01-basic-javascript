// Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

// Example:

const anAdjective = "awesome!";

let ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";

ourStr += anAdjective;

console.log(ourStr);

// ourStr would have the value freeCodeCamp is awesome!.

// TASK

// Set someAdjective to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to myStr using the += operator.

// Change code below this line

const someAdjective = " the best thing ever!!!";

let myStr = "Learning to code is ";

myStr += someAdjective;

console.log(myStr);
