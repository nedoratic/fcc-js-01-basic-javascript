// You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

// Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

// Example:

const firstName = "Ada";

const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

console.log(secondLetterOfFirstName);

// secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

// TASK

// Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.

// Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.

// Setup

const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line

const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];

console.log(thirdLetterOfLastName);
