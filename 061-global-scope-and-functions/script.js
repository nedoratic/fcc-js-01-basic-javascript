// In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables.

// Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

// Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const!

// TASK

// Using let or const, declare a global variable named myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.

// Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var, let or const keywords.

let myGlobal = 10;

function fun1() {
	oopsGlobal = 5;
}

function fun2() {
	let output = "";
	if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
		output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
	}
	if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
		output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
	}
	console.log(output);
}
